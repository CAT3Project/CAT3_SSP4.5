            “An Inconvenient Truth Threequel: Power in Numbers”<br>
            Stream it on Apple TV+<br><br>

            Cameron Ali’s masterfully created film takes a look at the history of Al Gore’s legacy as an ardent environmentalist. The 45th Vice-President under President Bill Clinton, Al Gore passed away two years ago at the age of 102 due to natural causes. It examines his early years in politics as the president of Harvard, which was ironically the only college he applied to. Despite his anti-war stance friends, he enlisted in the US army during the Vietnam War, hoping to save his father from having to deal with another politically charged issue. The film then moves on to his presidential runs and his term as vice-president, particularly his negotiation of the Kyoto Protocols. In the last 30 minutes, the documentary focuses on his Global Marshall Plan, a plan that would include rich and poor countries into a collaborative effort to fight climate change, and the pushback it received at the United Nations in 2034. Nonetheless, current revival of this plan has popularized Al Gore in the media again, making this film worthwhile to watch<br><br>


            “Climate State”<br>
            Stream it on Netflix<br><br>

            Premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to rave reviews, this documentary focuses on three high school students as they participate in a summer camp called Climate State hosted by the California state government in Sacramento. The point of Climate State was for 100 students interested in politics to create a national government in the context of the current climate challenges in 2052. The first participant is Ben Bernard, a white boy from Orange County with generally conservative views. Jennifer Chen is an Asian American from Santa Cruz with moderate political views. Lastly, there is John Garcia, a soft-spoken Hispanic from a blue collar family in Los Angeles with progressive views and a member of the Sunrise Movement. The film looks at how these three people split on ideological lines into three political parties — the conservative Union Party, the libertarian Identity Party, and liberal Socialist party. It dives deep into political polarization among youth today and the reason behind the creation of the Climate State. Without spoiling too much, this movie provides an expansive view of the power of youth advocacy to reduce carbon emissions.<br><br>
