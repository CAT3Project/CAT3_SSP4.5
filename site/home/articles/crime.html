            Around 11:32 PM on Friday, October 29th, 2052, an armed robbery took place in the local Heilongjiang grocery store. The suspects took the _ exit on highway _ at around 11:21 PM and entered the store located on 108 Guangdong Road in the Xiangfang district shortly after. Local witnesses claimed that the suspects were two middle-aged men with the height of 160 cm and 178 cm. It was reported that they wore black tank tops with gray jeans and took off in a black Chrysler Pacifica Electric minivan. It is believed that the vehicle was damaged on the right side near the door handle.<br><br>

            “I am in shock, and my emotions are mixed,” said Lihua Chen, the store owner. “A part of me is beyond grateful that the kids are safe, and nobody got hurt. However, this robbery is definitely going to affect our family. It has already been difficult to get by lately. I am not sure if we can afford the damages of this robbery.”<br><br>

            According to Lihua, her children were in the back storage doing homework when the robbers came in. One robber held her at gunpoint while the other took the cash in the register and gathered valuables in the shop. The robbers also vandalized the store by pushing multiple shelves over. Before exiting the store, the suspects aimed at the camera and shot a bullet, leaving the camera shattered. There were no customers in the store when the crime took place but a few neighborhood pedestrians were able to witness the scene and contact the police. By the time the officers got to the scene however, the suspects had fled.<br><br>

            It is believed that the suspects are workers of the Hongchen Farm located 10 miles North of the store. Local farm workspaces have suffered from the challenge to grow crops in the past few years. As the temperature continues to rise, changes take place in precipitation patterns and extreme weather conditions arise. As a result, it is more difficult to grow maize-based crops. China has been the 2nd top producer of corn for the past two decades, standing at over 250,000 metric tons annually, and Heilongjiang is the top producing province in China.<br><br>

            The average annual income for maize farmers has dramatically decreased in the past decade as the production of corn continues to decrease. The Hongchen Farm recently shut down and all workers are left jobless. Heilongjiang Police Department believes that the robbery may have been a crime of frustration from the farm workers.<br><br>
