            Around 9:32 PM on Friday, October 29th, 2052, an armed robbery took place in the local Heilongjiang grocery store. The suspects took exit 9A on highway S2 at around 9:21 PM and entered the store located on 108 Guangdong Road in the Xiangfang district shortly after. Local witnesses claimed that the suspects were two middle-aged men with the height of 160 cm and 178 cm. It was reported that they wore black tank tops with gray jeans and took off in a black Chrysler Pacifica All-Electric minivan. It is believed that the vehicle was damaged on the right side near the door handle.<br><br>

            “I am in shock, and my emotions are mixed,” said Lihua Chen, the store owner. “A part of me is beyond grateful that the kids are safe, and nobody got hurt. However, this robbery will definitely affect my family. It has already been difficult to get by lately. I am not sure if we can afford the damages of this robbery.”<br><br>

            According to Lihua, her children were in the back storage doing homework when the robbers came in. One robber held her and her children at gunpoint while the other took the cash in the register and gathered valuables in the shop. The robbers also vandalized the store by pushing multiple shelves over in the process of their hurried robbery. The store shelves are knocked over, and many store items are scattered on the floor. Before exiting the store, the suspects aimed at the camera and shot a bullet, leaving the camera shattered and recordings destroyed. There were no customers in the store when the crime took place as the shop was about to close but a few neighborhood pedestrians witnessed the scene and contacted the police. By the time the officers got to the scene however, the suspects had fled.<br><br>

            It is believed that the suspects are workers of the Hongchen Farm located 10 miles north of the store. Local farm workspaces have suffered from the challenge to grow crops in the past few years. As the temperature continues to rise unevenly throughout China, extreme weather conditions have become more common and precipitation patterns are becoming harder to predict. As a result, it is more difficult to grow maize-based crops. China has been the 2nd top producer of corn for the past two decades, standing at over 250,000 metric tons annually, and Heilongjiang is the top producing province in China.<br><br>

            With Climate Change exacerbating the farmland and precipitation patterns, the average annual income for maize farmers has dramatically decreased in the past decade. The demand for corn decreased as the production failed to meet its previous numbers. The Hongchen Farm recently shut down, leaving all the workers without a job. Heilongjiang Police Department believes that the robbery may have been committed out of frustration from the farm workers from the lack of help from the government and also due to the increased climate regulations that contributed to the farm’s bankruptcy. According to one study, anxiety among youth has been most apparent in areas affected by climate change the most.<br><br>

            This unfortunate event for Lihua Chen and her two children is one of many that demonstrate the economic damages of climate change. While the local police work to investigate the robbery, they have created a fundraiser page for the Chen family which viewers on MikMok can donate to. It is aimed to lend a helping hand to the family from the damages of such a crime.<br><br>
