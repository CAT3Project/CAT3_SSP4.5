            During the second presidential debate of the 2052 election, the issue of climate migration was the most heated debate topic between President Mitchell and the republican candidate Tonald Drump.<br><br>
            With the fairly strong economic growth in the past years, polling shows American voters are more focused on social rather than economic issues this election cycle. Climate migration is one of these social issues that has become very controversial recently, especially due to the continuously increasing rate of immigration spurred by climate change. Studies have found that in Mexico and Central America, over 10 million people are estimated to be displaced due to drought, rising sea levels, and other climate-related changes. The effects of these displaced people have been felt strongly at the southern border with record numbers of detained immigrants within the past few months.<br><br>
            When asked how they plan on handling this problem, Drump and Mitchell offered starkly different views. As expected, Drump went with a more conservative approach of increasing border security and decreasing immigration quotas, stating that “Mexico can deal with their own problems.” Mitchell, on the other hand, argued for increased funding for accommodating more immigrants and expanding policies that gave immigrant children a pathway toward citizenship.<br><br>
            During the debate, the two candidates exchanged heated rebuttals, with Mitchell criticizing Drump’s indifference to the suffering of others, while Drump bashed Mitchell for prioritizing foreigners over US citizens.<br><br>
            “The people in those countries are suffering from the climate change you just want to ignore. It’s inhumane!” Mitchell said during a particularly heated portion of the debate. Drump countered with an oddly familiar statement, saying “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us..”<br><br>
            The moderator also brought up domestic climate migration, with rising sea levels, wildfires, and storms destroying the homes of thousands, leaving them with nowhere to go. While Mitchell argued that a federally funded relief program was needed to help the victims, Drump countered by saying those people should not have lived in those high-risk areas in the first place. Instead, Drump proposed the states deal with the problems themselves since “people shouldn’t have to pay for the mistakes of others.”<br><br>
            It’s still unclear which candidate Americans support more. In general, people have lacked enthusiasm for spending significant amounts of tax money to solve climate issues over the past decade, though the record-breaking amount of climate migration may cause some to change their minds.<br><br>
