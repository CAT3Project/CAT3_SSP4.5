    <b>WHO WE ARE:</b><br>
    <i>The Geisel Times</i> was founded in March 2022. For over 30 years, the Times has written about climate challenges, war, conflicts, and many more events in America and around the world. The paper has won over 16 Pulitzer prizes, and we will continue to provide the facts, data, and information as accessible to the public as possible. The newsroom is completely separate from the Opinion section. In fact, a thick wall of 10 feet separates us! Our team of journalists adheres to the highest standards and ethics, and we will always dedicate our time, energy, and lives toward upholding the truth and only the truth<br><br>
