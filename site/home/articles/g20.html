            G20 leaders End Meeting Early After Feud Over Climate Responsibility

            A meeting at the Group of 20 nations summit ended early after discussions on climate repayments turned heated. Hosted by President Mitchell in Philadelphia, the emergency G20 summit comes at a time when China was hit with heavy rainfall that caused flooding in the Yangtze River, killing thousands and causing at least $73 billion in economic damages. At the summit, many developing nations like Brazil, Indonesia, and Argentina demanded that industrialized countries – a list that includes the United States, the European Union, Australia, and more – pay a fair share for the destruction caused by their historic climate emissions.<br><br>
            A spokesperson for the G20 summit declined to comment further than to state that “the media should not make conjectures, especially on the first of four days of meetings.” Nonetheless, the walkout by leaders of the G7 alliance points to a hardened stance toward developing countries like India which currently is emitting more carbon dioxide per capita.<br><br>
            White House press secretary Andrew Vanderbilt pushed back against allegations that a rift among industrialized and developing countries was growing. “Such talk over relatively little information is immature. Our Special Presidential Envoy for Climate is still engaging in constructive talks on a climate policy that will benefit all countries.”<br><br>
            Given the current state of the climate and global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are still at an all-time high despite a trend down starting in 2050, climate change has been an issue that is politically fraught and filled with economic risks. This comes as industrialized nations aim to cut down their use of fossil fuels, fueling an arms race for green technology, such as nuclear fusion, highly efficient solar panels, and high-energy density batteries that can be charged quite quickly. This energy diversification will serve as insurance from geopolitical tensions that may cause geopolitical foes to ban fossil fuel exports. Tai Chung, an expert on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that the recent economic and social conflicts that arose from climate change are fueling an isolationist foreign policy. This has severe consequences for developing countries that still are heavily reliant on foreign aid and a growing economy dependent on fossil fuels.<br><br>
            Under current conditions, scientific consensus predicts that annual carbon dioxide emissions will reach close to 0 GtCO2/yr a little bit after 2100 as long as enough countries achieve the targets they set for themselves. Sarah Birk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego at the School of Global Policy & Strategy, wrote in an email that President Mitchell’s tough stance on other countries fits with his recent election promises to put American values first as he is facing criticisms from his Republican colleagues who claim he is prioritizing other countries’ citizens over Americans. “Still, there is plenty of room for compromise. They just may have to go through proxies such as nations like Switzerland.”<br><br>
