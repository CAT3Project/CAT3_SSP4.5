            A meeting at the Group of 20 nations summit ended early after discussions on climate repayments turned heated. Hosted by President Mitchell in Philadelphia, the emergency G20 summit comes at a time when China was hit with heavy rainfall that caused flooding in the Yangtze river, killing thousands and causing at least $73 billion in economic damages. President Wang of the People Republic of China, along with nations including Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia , demanded that industrialized countries – a list that includes the United States, the European Union, Australia, and more – pay a fair share for the destruction caused by their historic climate emissions.<br><br>
            A spokesperson for the G20 summit declined to comment further than to state that “the media should not make conjectures especially on the first of four days of meeting.” Nonetheless, the walkout by leaders of the G7 alliance points to a hardened stance toward China, whom they no longer see as a developed country, and other developing countries who currently are emitting more carbon dioxide per capita.<br><br>
            White House press secretary Andrew Vanderbilt pushed back against allegations that a rift among industrialized and developing countries was growing. “Such talk over relatively little information is idiotic. Our Special Presidential Envoy for Climate is still engaging in constructive talks on a climate policy that will benefit all countries.”<br><br>
            Given the current state of the climate and global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are still at an all-time high despite a trend down starting in 2050, climate change has been an issue that is  politically fraught and filled with economic risks. This comes, despite an arms race for green technology, as developed nations aimed to cut down their reliance on developing countries which still are rich in natural gas and coal.<br><br>
            Under current conditions, scientific consensus predicts that annual carbon dioxide emissions will reach close to 0 GtCO2/yr as long as enough countries achieve the targets they set for themselves under the San Diego agreement back in 2046. Sarah Birk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego at the School of Global Policy & Strategy, wrote in an email that President Mitchell’s tough stance on China fits with his election promises to put American values first and to stop China from using its geopolitical leverage to get votes at the UN. “Still, there is plenty of room for compromise. They just may have to go through proxies such as nations like Switzerland.”<br><br>
