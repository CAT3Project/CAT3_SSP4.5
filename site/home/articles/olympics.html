            The 2052 Summer Olympics, opened with swimmer Abdullah Khan lighting the Olympic flame after a three-month delay from August after repeated intense heat waves prevented many athletes from being able to compete.<br><br>
            The stadium in Riyadh was devoid of spectators as many in Saudi Arabia, tourists included, opted to watch the event on television within their AC-controlled environments. To some long-time Olympic Fans, the opening ceremony greatly reminded them of the 2020 Tokyo Games when the coronavirus pandemic forced Japan to ban spectators. The recent addition of the new solar panel technologies — roughly 70% efficient — is a political move aimed at rebranding the oil-rich kingdom, which has made slow adaptation to the climate challenges in the 21st century, into a climate-friendly nation. This will likely help increase tourism as many wealthy tourists are now looking at nations’ “climate scores” to judge whether a country is worth traveling to without increasing their carbon footprint.<br><br>
            Athletes from aquatic sports like water polo, swimming, and diving were indifferent to the delay. Diver James Fung from Canada said it felt nice to cool off while competing in their event, but laughed while saying no one cooled off at the hot tub provided to the divers. Others, mostly track & field and soccer athletes, were satisfied with the delay, after worries that the heat may increase the risk of injury or worse death. Most runners know that in these temperatures, breaking the world record in an outdoor event is becoming harder every year.<br><br>
            The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has faced numerous criticism over the decades because they ban climate change and other political advocacy among athletes, said that the games will continue regardless of any future unpredictable weather conditions. It also acknowledged the carbon impact of hosting the Olympic events. The President of the IOC has stated, “we are proud of the Saudi [Arabia] government’s commitment to making this year's games the first carbon-neutral Olympics.”<br><br>
            <b>Here is also a guide:</b><br>
            What is the first event of the Riyadh Games and when does it start?<br>
            It starts at 9 a.m. Monday, November 4th at the King Fahd Stadium. That is 11 p.m. in San Francisco, 2 a.m. in New York City, and 7 a.m. in London<br><br>
            <b>How do I watch the games?</b><br>
            In the US, NBC will cover all of the games. In Europe, EUROSPORT gained broadcast rights and in Asia, Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union is the broadcasting company.<br><br>
            <b>How do I follow my favorite athletes?</b><br>
            The popular social media and virtual reality platform, MikMok, is where all the athletes have their channels to follow how they do. A medal counter can be found in the Nexus.<br><br>
            <b>What are the sports to watch?</b><br>
            This year a new sport is added to these games which will be worth watching: indoor marathon, in which runners run 1051.5 track laps. The sport comes as the outdoor marathon was canceled for yet another Olympics as heatwaves have made outdoor running dangerous.<br><br>
