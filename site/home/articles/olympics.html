            The 2052 Summer Olympics, opened with swimmer Abdullah Khan lighting the Olympic flame after a three month delay from August after repeated intense heat waves prevented many athletes from being able to compete.<br><br>
            The stadium in Riyadh was devoid of spectators as many in Saudi Arabia, tourists included, opted to watch the event on television within AC-controlled environments. To some fervent Olympic Fans, the opening ceremony greatly reminded them of the 2020 Tokyo Games when the coronavirus pandemic forced Japan to ban spectators.<br><br>
            Athletes from aquatic sports like water polo, swimming, and diving were indifferent to the delay as many said it felt nice to cool off while competing in the event. Others, mostly track & field and soccer athletes, were satisfied with the delay, after worries that the heat may increase risk of injury or in fact death.<br><br>
            The International Olympic Committee, which has faced numerous criticism over the decades because they ban climate change advocacy among athletes, said that the games will continue regardless of any future unpredictable weather conditions.<br><br>
            Hereâ€™s a guide:<br><br>

            <b>How do I watch the games?</b><br><br>
            In the US, NBC will cover all of the games. In Europe, EUROSPORT gained broadcast rights and in Asia, Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union is the broadcasting company.<br><br>
            <b>How do I follow my favorite athletes?</b><br><br>
